\section{Future}
There is evidently no way to know with certainty what the future has in store, and this is true also when it comes to technical development. On the other hand, knowing what the prominent factors are, one can more easily predict this development. It can be seen that the history of input and output devices has not had a tight connection to that of computer processing power and memory, although the lack of which can delay the popularisation of such devices. Some examples of this are mentioned above; the computer terminal, which gained in popularity first when computer memory became more easily available and the use of neural networks (not only for sound processing) which gained in popularity again in the 1980's, when processing power had increased. According to the famous Moore's law[reference], the number of transistors and hence chip performance doubles approximately every two years, further leading us to believe that this is not the main issue.

The development rather aspires to ease the interaction either by making devices more portable and available or to remove the obstacles present in the interaction. This is well examplified by the "Google Glass" project currently under development, which aims to provide both higher portability and more natural input methods. Additionally, this section will cover the use of gesture based systems, and systems to control devices directly by thought.
