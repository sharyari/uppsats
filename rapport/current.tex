Several input devices in this paper such as the keyboard and the mouse, are still wildely used but can be seen as historical devices. This is justified by the fact that they remain largely unchainged - if not in their physical design then in the fashion they are used [©itation needed]. On the other hand, a number of other input/output devices that can be seen as to be recent have a long history behind them. taken a larger and larger market share. Although \emph{touchpads}, \emph{touchscreens} and \emph{speak recognition} techniques were researched as far back as the 1960's \cite{buxton}\cite{shoebox}, they have only now began to see commercial use and have likely still not reached their "peak". 


\subsection{Touch devices}
Touchscreen devices have become increasingly popular during the last years, through the breakthrough of \emph{smart devices} (i.e. smart phones and tablets) running specialized operating systems such as the Apple's iOS and Google's Android. The technology used in these devices however, have evolved over over a much longer time.

One of the first mentions of touchscreens was by E.A. Johnson in 1965, describing a touchscreen and identifying some potential uses in a short article, less than a single page\cite{4205802}. Some of the earliest developed systems came in the beginning of the 1970's. Early prototypes are the PLATO \cite{buxton} (1972) and a transparant touchscreen was developed and put to use by CERN in 1973\cite{cern}.

The initial uses of touchscreens were point-to-select systems used in for example ATM machines or cash registers in restaurants and were relatively non-demanding on the screen performance\cite{buxton}. But there were also early attemps to make \emph{PDAs}\footnote{Personal Digital Assistant}. The first products to enter the market were the Palm Zoomer and the IBM Simon. The Simon was a mobile phone without any physical buttons, having only a touchscreen as its working area. But beyond regular telephone capabilities, it could also manage information such as a telephone book and be used for drawing and taking notes. Due to this, it is sometimes refered to as the first \emph{smartphone}\cite{buxton}.

Smartphones have seen much development since the release of Simon, and today (2013) it is estimated that more than a billion people use smartphones\cite{billion1}\cite{billion2}. [KORT STYCKE MED REFERENS SOM SÄGER ATT DET ÄR PGA ANDROID OCH IOS]. 

This increase in the number of touch-based devices has changed the way in which we interact with computers. STYCKE SOM PRATAR OM VAD SKILLNADEN ÄR: SVÅRARE ATT ANVÄNDA TANGENTBORD, LÄTTARE ATT GÖRA ANNAT SOM ATT TEX LÄSA BÖCKER, KÖPA SAKER MM.
While the keyboard and mouse approach requires the user to find the cursor on the display, move it to the desired location and click the mouse to activate it, the touch screen gives the user the ability to point directly at the desired item at the screen to activate it. The use of an on screen keyboard that only appears when it is needed has allowed the computers to be stripped down to just the display without dedicated input devices. This has made computers so portable that they can be used in almost any context and in a very user friendly way [JAG TROR JAG KAN HITTA EN BRA REFERENS I MIN HCI-BOK]. The tablet is so simple in its design that it can be used by small kids and even cats [KANSKE OINTRESSANT, MEN EN ROLIG GREJ].

%Multitouch. Vad är det, och varför?
One of the big breakthroughs that has allowed the touch screen to become the only input device required by a computer is the introduction of multi finger gestures. While touch screens previously only handled one action ("left mouse button"), the use of multi hand gestures removes the need for "icons" [DET FANNS ETT BRA ORD I NÅN ARTIKEL, HITTA!], freeing up the screen real estate to only contain the information of interest. The rest of the functionality can be reached by "pinching", one or multi finger gestures, while still keeping the basic "mouse click" functionality easily available by a single screen tap.

\subsection{Voice recognition}

Voice recognition is another input method that has become increasingly popular during the last 13 years. This input method uses voice to text methods (bättre namn?) by analyzing input from the microphone. The text this method gives can be parsed by the computer to perform a predefined action depending on the program. Microsoft has recently presented a Spoken english to synthesised speech chinese translator.
