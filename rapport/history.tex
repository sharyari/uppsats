\section{History}
In 1946, the ENIAC computer was completed for the United States Army and it has been argued whether ENIAC is to be seen as the first digital computer\cite{McCartney1999}, or if this title belongs to the ABC computer (1942)\cite{court}. Regardless, it is clear that the history of the underlying computer interface used by both the ENIAC and the ABC is longer than the history of the computers themselves.

Already in the beginning of the 18th century Basile Bouchon started using perforated paper to control the textile looms used for weaving[citation needed]. To control the cords of a warp thick paper rolls were punched with patterns of holes, each column corresponding to a cord. The cord was then raised or lowered, depending on whether the paper was punched or not. In this manner Bouchons machine managed to automatise part of the weaving process, and allowed for more complex weaving patterns.
