\begin{abstract}
This paper reviews the history, current state, and future of input and output methods, and the factors leading up to their invention. It hopes to explain what the current trends in development are and which new computer assisted applications they allow. 

The paper summarises the history of a selcted set of computer interaction devices, from punch cards to the mouse and keyboard, and goes on to investigate the devices in popular use today. Using the knowledge of the factors behind previous and contemporary devices, the paper goes on to present two possible future methods, gesture control and brain-computer interfaces, that follow the same trend of development.

The report conclueds that the development in interaction methods has become highly user-centered, and goes towards a higher level of abstraction between the user and the machine. It also shows that advances in technology not necessarily replace the previous technology, but rather broaden the spectra of applications where computers are used.

Input and output devices and methods is a broad subject and this paper does not assume to present a complete coverage thereof. It rather presents a deep enough coverage of the most prominent aspects in the field, in order to see the general patterns.
