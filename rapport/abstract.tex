This paper reviews the history, current state, and future of input and output methods, and the factors leading up to their invention. It hopes to explain <fråga 1, fråga 2, fråga 3>. We cr eated a simple two-player game Pr oject
Zion, which can be played with any one of a number of differ ent
input devices, both tr aditional and alter native, e.g. mouse,
keyboar d, Xbox 360 contr oller , Wii Remote, dance mat, Phantom
Omni haptic device, SpacePilot Pr o, and webcam. We then
enlisted par ticipants to play the game in pair s with one of the
selection of input methods (each player in the pair can use a
differ ent input method to their opponent) and then asked them to
fill in a questionnair e about their pr evious game playing
exper ience, opinions on games that make use of alter native input
methods.
The pr oject comes to the conclusion that alter native input
methods can incr ease the immer sion and fun player s per ceive,
pr ovided that the input method used fits the game mechanics.
Player s expr ess negative feelings when playing a game with an
input method that does not suit the game mechanics, feeling that
it is mer ely a gimmick. The r esult also shows that player s’
per ceptions of alter native input methods ar e tied to their
pr evious exper iences with that input method.
